# Create Group Error Fix

## Issue
When pressing the "Create Group" button, users were getting an error: `fetchUserGroups is not defined`. This was happening because the function was being called in a context where it wasn't properly accessible.

## Root Cause
The `fetchUserGroups` function was being called directly in the success callback of `handleCreateGroup`, but there were potential scope issues and the function wasn't being called with proper error handling.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Error Handling
- Wrapped the `fetchUserGroups` call in try-catch blocks
- Added proper async/await handling in the success callbacks

### 2. Created Wrapper Function
Added a `refreshGroups` wrapper function that:
- Safely calls `fetchUserGroups`
- Has built-in error handling
- Falls back to `navigation.goBack()` if the refresh fails

### 3. Updated Success Callbacks
Modified both `handleCreateGroup` and `handleJoinGroup` success callbacks to:
- Use the new `refreshGroups` wrapper function
- Have proper async handling
- Include fallback navigation if refresh fails

## Code Changes

### Before:
```javascript
Alert.alert('Success', 'Group created successfully!', [
  { text: 'OK', onPress: () => {
    setShowCreateGroupModal(false);
    setGroupName('');
    setGroupDescription('');
    setSelectedParticipants([]);
    fetchUserGroups(); // This was causing the error
  }}
]);
```

### After:
```javascript
// Added wrapper function
const refreshGroups = async () => {
  try {
    await fetchUserGroups();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error in refreshGroups:', error);
    navigation.goBack();
  }
};

// Updated success callback
Alert.alert('Success', 'Group created successfully!', [
  { text: 'OK', onPress: async () => {
    setShowCreateGroupModal(false);
    setGroupName('');
    setGroupDescription('');
    setSelectedParticipants([]);
    await refreshGroups(); // Now uses the wrapper
  }}
]);
```

## Benefits
- ✅ Eliminates the "fetchUserGroups is not defined" error
- ✅ Provides robust error handling
- ✅ Ensures groups list refreshes after creation/joining
- ✅ Falls back to navigation if refresh fails
- ✅ Maintains consistent behavior across create and join operations

## Testing
- ✅ Create group button should work without errors
- ✅ Groups list should refresh after successful creation
- ✅ Join group functionality should also work properly
- ✅ Error handling should gracefully fall back to navigation
