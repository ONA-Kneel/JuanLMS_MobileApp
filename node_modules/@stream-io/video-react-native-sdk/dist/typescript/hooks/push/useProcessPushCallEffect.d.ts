/**
 * This hook is used to process the incoming call data via push notifications using the relevant rxjs subjects
 * It either joins or leaves the call based on the user's action.
 * Note: this effect cannot work when push notifications are received when the app is in quit state or in other words when the client is not connected with a websocket.
 * So we essentially run this effect only when the client is connected with a websocket.
