 * This hook is used to process the non ringing call data via push notifications using the relevant rxjs subject
 * Note: this effect cannot work when push notifications are received when the app is in quit state or in other words when the client is not connected with a websocket.
 * So we essentially run this effect only when the client is connected with a websocket.
