# React Native Picker Issue Fix

## Problem Description

The project was encountering a Gradle build error related to `@react-native-picker/picker`:

```
A problem occurred evaluating project ':react-native-picker_picker'.
> [react-native-picker] Unable to resolve react-native location in node_modules. 
> You should add project extension property (in app/build.gradle) `REACT_NATIVE_NODE_MODULES_DIR` 
> with path to react-native.
```

This error occurs because:
1. The `@react-native-picker/picker` package is not fully compatible with Expo's managed workflow
2. The package tries to resolve React Native's location during Android builds but can't find it
3. This is a common issue when using Expo with packages that require native Android configuration

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Replaced @react-native-picker/picker with CustomDropdown

Created a custom dropdown component (`CustomDropdown.js`) that provides the same functionality without the native dependencies:

- **Location**: `frontend/components/Shared/CustomDropdown.js`
- **Features**: Modal-based dropdown, customizable styling, touch-friendly interface
- **Compatibility**: Works with Expo managed workflow, no native dependencies

### 2. Updated Components

Modified the following components to use the new CustomDropdown:

- `frontend/components/Faculty/CreateActivity.js` - Question type selector
- `JuanLMS_MobileApp/components/Admin/AdminAuditTrail.js` - User filter dropdown

### 3. Removed Problematic Package

Removed `@react-native-picker/picker` from:
- `frontend/package.json`
- Dependencies will be cleaned up during reinstallation

## Files Modified

### New Files Created:
- `frontend/components/Shared/CustomDropdown.js`
- `JuanLMS_MobileApp/components/Shared/CustomDropdown.js`
- `fix-picker-issue.bat` (Windows batch script)
- `fix-picker-issue.ps1` (PowerShell script)
- `PICKER_ISSUE_FIX_README.md` (this file)

### Files Modified:
- `frontend/components/Faculty/CreateActivity.js`
- `JuanLMS_MobileApp/components/Admin/AdminAuditTrail.js`
- `frontend/package.json`

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Use the Scripts (Recommended)
1. Run `fix-picker-issue.ps1` (PowerShell) or `fix-picker-issue.bat` (Command Prompt)
2. The script will clean up dependencies and reinstall them

### Option 2: Manual Cleanup
1. Delete all `node_modules` directories:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   rm -rf frontend/node_modules
   rm -rf backend/node_modules
   ```

2. Delete package-lock.json files:
   ```bash
   rm package-lock.json
   rm frontend/package-lock.json
   rm backend/package-lock.json
   ```

3. Reinstall dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm run install-all
   ```

## Benefits of the Solution

1. **Expo Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with Expo managed workflow
2. **No Native Dependencies**: Eliminates Android build issues
3. **Better UX**: Custom modal-based dropdown with improved styling
4. **Maintainable**: Pure React Native component, easier to customize
5. **Cross-Platform**: Works consistently across iOS, Android, and Web

## CustomDropdown Component Features

- **Props**:
  - `selectedValue`: Currently selected value
  - `onValueChange`: Callback when selection changes
  - `items`: Array of `{label, value}` objects
  - `placeholder`: Text shown when no item is selected
  - `style`: Custom styles for the container
  - `itemStyle`: Custom styles for the button
  - `dropdownStyle`: Custom styles for the dropdown button

- **Styling**: Fully customizable with StyleSheet
- **Accessibility**: Proper touch targets and visual feedback
- **Performance**: Efficient rendering with FlatList

## Testing

After applying the fix:
1. Test the dropdown functionality in both components
2. Verify that the build process completes without errors
3. Test on different platforms (iOS, Android, Web)

## Future Considerations

- The CustomDropdown component can be extended with additional features
- Consider adding animation options for smoother transitions
- Can be reused across the project for consistent UI patterns

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:
1. Ensure all dependencies are properly reinstalled
2. Check that the CustomDropdown component is properly imported
3. Verify that the component paths are correct
4. Clear Metro bundler cache: `npx expo start --clear`
